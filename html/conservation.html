							Conservation is a practice of protecting which primarily focus on maintaining 
							good health of the natural world; an activity of systematically protecting resources.
							One aspect of the natural world is the biodiversity. Nowadays, the term conservation 
							is not applied to the tern nature, but it also covers the concepts such as anthropology, 
							cultural diversity and genetic diversity.

						Nowadays, environmental issues such as the extinction of an endangered species and the
						importance of conservation are well aware by the people who are interested in
						environmental matters. However, what needs more attention is the subject of conserving
						cultures, especially local cultures. Cultures are not only threatened by the globalization
						of products and brands, but also by the desire to become closest to the world leading
						countries. People, especially in developing countries, often leave behind what they know
						and become the closest to the westerner as they can. This leads to the disappearance of
						various cultural practices and traditions.

						In conclusion, <span style="font-weight:bold; font-size:150%;">conservation</span> is not 
						only applied in the field of wildlife or 
						biodiversity, but it is also mentioned in 
						when talking about maintaining cultural 
						diversity. A conservation movement 
						could not be done by a person, but a 
						group of people who see the value of 
						what they want to protect. Every person 
						has their own beloved things.
